This prototype is a dialogue &#xA;system meant to assist you with the basic functionality of this process.&#xA;&#xA;You can use natural language to interact with the system, and commands are &#xA;flexible. You can identify a class with either class department and number, or&#xA;with the name directly.  You can add a class, remove a class, move it to &#xA;another semester. You can bookmark a class to save it for later, and ask about&#xA; your requirements that you need to fill for your major."
